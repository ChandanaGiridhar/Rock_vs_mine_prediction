# Rock vs Mine Prediction using SONAR Data

## About

Outwardly SONAR technique has
exploited the discovery of rocks and minerals
which would have been very difficult otherwise.
The technique exploits certain parameters which
will aid to detect the surface targets or obstacle
such as a rock or a mine. Machine learning has
drawn the attention of maximum part of todayâ€™s
emerging technology, related from banking to
many consumer and product based industries, by
showing the advancements in the predictive
analytics. 

## DataSet
The dataset has
been collected from UCI Repository. It has come
across 61 features which define and differentiate
Rocks and Mines and comprises of 209 samples. 
This data is used for training and testing purpose. The Last column in the dataset 
indicates that whether it s a mine or rock which is useful in prediction.
The dataset is included in this repository.

## Model
The model used here is  **Logistic Regression**. Logistic regression is a statistical model that in its basic form uses a logistic function to model a binary dependent variable
As it a binary classification model it is perfect to predict if an object is mine or rock based on the sonar data.
